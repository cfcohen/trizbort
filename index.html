          </h1>

            <p>Trizbort is a simple tool used to create maps for interactive fiction.  First developed by <a href="http://trizbort.genstein.net">genstein</a> back in 2010, he continued to update until March, 2013 when he open-sourced the code.
                Fast forward to 2015 when I picked up the development and along with Andrew Schultz (focused on documentation and testing) we continue to improve this great software.

            <ul>
                <li>ENH: #196 - "tb dotted" in transcript now forces next connection to be dotted.</li>
                <li>ENH: #11 - "tb exit [direction]" in transcript will add a connection stub in that direction and "tb noexit [direction]" will remove a connection stub.</li>
                <li>ENH: #270 - refactored the command line handling. Commands are now:<br/>
                    -a, --loadlastproject<br/>
                    -m, --automap --> give it a text file transcript. ex) trizbort --automap zork1.txt<br/>
                    -q, --quicksave --> quicksave the file to the given filename, useful in conjunction with other commands like --automap<br/>
                    -s, --smartsave --> silently do smartsave based on current smartsave settings.<br/>
                    -x, --exit --> close trizbort, again useful in conjunction with other arguments. ex) trizbort --automap zork1.txt --quicksave zork1.trizbort --exit<br/>
                </li>
                <li>ENH: #267 - added command line parameters for exporting maps to source files --inform7, --inform6, --alan, --hugo, --tads, --zil</li>
                <li>ENH: #186 - Added region support to Hugo export.</li>
                <li>ENH: #279 - Added Ctrl-K to Force Darkness on selected rooms; Added Ctrl-Shift-K to force lighted on rooms.</li>
                <li>ENH: #56 - Added support for doors. It can be setup in the connection properties. Export to I7 only at this point.</li>
                <li>ENH: #285 - Add descriptions to connections. Used only for doors at the moment.</li>
                <li>ENH: #283 - Allow for fine control of object text positioning.</li>
                <li>COS: #294 - Fix wording on context menu for hand-drawn room.</li>
                <li>ENH: - Tooltips will now show on items with out a title. This will help with being able to put different attributes or descriptions on items (connections, rooms).</li>
                <li>ENH: #295 - Added option to app settings to show / not-show tooltips on objects.</li>
                <li>REF: #214 - Refactored font code name.</li>
                <li>REF: #213 - changed labels in app settings font settings</li>

            </h4>
            <p>We made a lot of improvements to exporting to your favorite IF language and cleaning up our own code. We are also trying to add features that make sense to simplify building of maps while still giving you plenty of shortcuts and power tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also in the process of improving the export to different languages. We've added ALAN support and improved support for I7, I6, TADS and ZIL. As always if you find ways to improve, have suggestions or find bugs, please let us know or submit an issue
                on github. Documentation is a little outdated so apologies on that. Hopefully we'll be updating that soon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ENH: - beginning of object definition language in the objects list. Still in beta (so use at own risk as things may change, but feedback is appreciated) and really focused on I7 at the moment. We will continue to improve, fix and tweak.</li>
                <li>ENH: #23 - Command line option to start automapping of file. -m transcriptfile [trizbort map name]</li>
                <li>ENH: #27 - Saves app window dimensions on close.</li>
                <li>ENH: #40 - Also #192, Now we can adjust margins on exported images. We allow for default margins that can be adjusted and document specific margins.</li>
                <li>ENH: #81 - Annotations can be now be saved to PDFs (the annotation will be the room description)</li>
                <li>ENH: #170 - The short cut key '0' will select the starting room.</li>
                <li>ENH: #184 - Ctrl-B backs up your current project file.</li>
                <li>ENH: #185 - TADS/Adv3Lite export now supports regions.</li>
                <li>ENH: #188 - \ (backslash) on room will attempt to reorganize the connections. Be careful with this as it tries to be smart about room location in relevence to each other. It can make mistakes so we are looking at ways to improve and make trizbort a bit smarter.</li>
                <li>ENH: #189 - '[' and ']' as well as Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-] will move the selected connector around to available ports on the connected rooms.</li>
                <li>ENH: #197 - Automap improvements: Mark start room.</li>
                <li>ENH: #202 - Option to auto-load the last saved map when opening trizbort.</li>
                <li>ENH: #203 - More command line options added (just beginning this, -? for current ones)</li>

                <li>ENH: #264 - Hand-drawn is now a room property. Global setting for new rooms, can be changed on a room level.</li>
                <li>COS: #182 - Wording change on the duplicate room dialog in automapper.</li>
                <li>COS: #200 - File dialog for choosing transcript in automapper now filters by *.txt and *.log -- Any other extensions in common use for transcripts?</li>
                <li>FIX: #172 - Disallow room names to be just numbers as it creates bad I7 code.</li>
                <li>FIX: #173 - Like #172, Blank room names are not allowed as it will create bad exported code.</li>
                <li>FIX: #180 - When running a test command in the I7 IDE, command numbers in brackets are created at the front of each prompt line, like '>[7] n', this confused the automapper.</li>
                <li>FIX: #234 - Trying to improve the export to code with some special characters from non-english languages. (Further improvement suggestions welcome)</li>
                <li>FIX: #246 - Fixed some areas that were causing Trizbort to think the map was "dirty" and needed saved when it really wasn't.</li>
            </ul>
